## About

Formless Forms are a small Angular components library with the objective of providing components that can be combined in any fashion to create dynamic forms with validation that do not require html template forms. Formless Forms are flexible, dynamic, and extendable across frameworks / applications.

## Demo

Here is a [demo site showing formless-form elements](https://github.com/superman2971/formless-forms) in action.

## Usage Example

Simple Examples for a few components such as the _Standard Input_:

```json
{
  "code": "./formless-forms",
  "sample": "@superman2971",
  "etc": "0.0.0",
  "FormlessForms": {
    "MakeIt": {
      "Happen": "We'll place code usage examples here"
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

* Elements
  * Standard Input Component

### TO DO

Much more still in development. Will be adding components for elements, dynamic validations and styles, and also considering adding in modals, buttons, cards, etc.
